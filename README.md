Machine Learning Model Training in Simple Linear Regression

ML Model Training in Simple Linear Regression with Data Cleaning, Pre-Processing, EDA, Training Model, Testing Model, Validation Model, Final Accuracy of Model.

Code in Jupyter Notebook. In this Project I do Data Cleaning, Data Preprocessing, EDA, Training Model, Testing Model.

To Run this project you need a Jupyter Notebook in your system. also I uploaded a dataset file for the same first download it in your system & copy the path of dataset file & paste it in importing dataset column after pd.read_excel you have to paste the path of dataset file. after that you can run each & every cell to run it

Simple Linear Regression is a type of Regression algorithms that models the relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable. The relationship shown by a Simple Linear Regression model is linear or a sloped straight line, hence it is called Simple Linear Regression.
